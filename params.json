{"name":"Bencho","tagline":"A C++ benchmarking framework.","body":"# Bencho\r\n\r\nBencho is a C++ benchmarking framework that will help you create and run your own benchmarks.\r\n\r\n## Current Status\r\n\r\nThe Bencho Framework can be used already, but it is still in development. Features can change or will be added and even some basic functionality could change in the next versions. \r\n\r\nThe following features are currently implemented:\r\n\r\n  * Create benchmarks by using the AbstractBenchmark as template\r\n  * Add Parameters easily\r\n  * Measure different performance counters at the same time\r\n  * Register different test series\r\n  * Supports warm-up runs, calibration runs, chache clearing, parameter versions\r\n  * All common aggregating functions included in an Aggregator\r\n  * Save results in CSV formated files\r\n  * Plot results directly via Gnuplot, Python matplotlib or R ggplot2\r\n  \r\n## Building\r\n\r\nSupported operating systems are Linux and Mac OS X, however the PAPI library wont work on the Apple operating systems.\r\n\r\nTo build the Bencho framework you will only need to execute \r\n\r\n\tmake\r\n\r\nIf not specified already, it will automatically ask you for your prefered Configuration of the options production mode, papi use and verbose build. If you want to change these settings later just execute\r\n\r\n\tmake config\r\n\r\nThe Bencho framework is now ready to use. On how to include this framework in your project best, please take a look at the [Bencho Sample](https://github.com/schwald/benchosample) or at the documentation.\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\nThe Bencho project provides a doxygen documentation of all classes that you find in the doxygen folder.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nBencho is licensed as open source after the OpenSource \"Licence of the Hasso-Plattner Institute\" declared in the LICENSE file of this project. \r\n\r\nQuestion: Why does Bencho not use MIT or BSD or XX license. The reason for our\r\napproach comes with the German copyright law. Common BSD and MIT licenses are\r\nnot necessarily compatible and thus can potentially lead to problems. To\r\novercome this problem this project uses an specifically designed open source\r\nlicense to be compatible with German law. The most prominent difference is the\r\nexclusion of all liabilities which is not possible in Germany.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
